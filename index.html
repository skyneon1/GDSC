            <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">
                Remember 2003? Before Chrome, Google Calendar, Android, and YouTube? When we carefully cleaned up our saved emails because GMail and its gigabyte of storage hadn't arrived? Two decades ago – Google launched a global coding competition called Code Jam, which challenged programmers of all levels to test and hone their skills by racing to solve algorithmic problems. <br>
                Developer Student Clubs (DSC) is a programme in collaboration with Google Developers that targets passionate students from developer communities across the globe. Be it Android, Cloud or Data Science - this is a unique platform for students to not just learn through P2P workshops but solve actual real-world problems for the local community through sponsored projects. IIT Indore is now part of the few institutes that have been selected for this program.
